UI ELEMENT IDENTIFICATION GUIDELINES:

7. For menus and dropdowns, click on the appropriate menu item text
8. Consider the context of the user's command when selecting elements

COORDINATE ACCURACY:
1. Provide precise coordinates for click actions
2. Ensure coordinates are within the bounds of the identified UI element

4. Account for potential UI scaling and resolution differences
5. Avoid clicking too close to edges of elements

COMMAND INTERPRETATION:
